# Analysis-and-Design

- What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I needed to design and create a program that would, given an input file with a specified format that contains course information, read in each of the courses as well as their prerequisites and then place them into an appropriate data structure.  The proram was also to inform the user if there are any format errors in the input file.

- How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
My approach to the problem was to break it down into sections, and think about the steps individually.  I used the example input file for reference and made sure to ahere to the formatting that was going to be expected. I had to familiarize myself with how to do similar tasks/operations in the three data structures that were being considered (i.e. Hash Tables, Vectors, and Binary Search Trees).  

- How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
One major roadblock I encountered while going through these projects was the decision of which data structre to choose.  All of them had strengths and weaknesses in regards to different tasks.  I was able to overcome this by making a decision on how I expected the user to use my program, and I prioritized speed on the operations that I decided would be used most frequently.  

- How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Through this project, I now have a much better understanding of how to desing and implement programs.  I had to consider things I had never considered before, such as how to go about choosing the best data structure to hold information and evaluating how the decision would impact my program's performance.  

- How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Before this project, I never made much attempt to comment my code, which, in hindsight, is horrible for maintainability.  However, because of the fact that I had to work on this project over the course of an extended period of time, I realized that making comments is neccessary for long term development so that I can be sure to know why/how I made a particular programming decision.  Doing this also helps to summarize large blocks of code which fascilitates my ability to adapt the code to future changes.
